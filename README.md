# Zeham Management Technologies “T5” BootCamp Repository

Welcome to my Data Science and Artificial Intelligence BootCamp repository! This repository contains all my work during the bootcamp, including weekly topics, exercises, and projects, as well as my final Capstone Project. Below is a brief overview of the structure and contents of this repository.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main folders:

## 1. Capstone Project
This folder contains the files and documentation for my capstone project.

For more details, please refer to the Capstone README.

## 2. Weekly Tasks and Topics
This folder contains all the materials, exercises, and projects completed during each week of the bootcamp. Each week focuses on a specific topic in AI, Machine Learning, or Data Science, providing practical exercises and projects to reinforce the learning. Below is an overview of the weekly topics covered:

### Week 1: Introduction to Data Science
Overview of data science fundamentals, tools, and workflows.

### Week 2: Foundations of Machine Learning
Introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning, basic algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

### Week 3: Advanced Machine Learning
Exploration of more advanced techniques, including ensemble learning, gradient boosting, and regularization.

### Week 4: Deep Learning
Basics of neural networks, backpropagation, and common deep learning architectures.

### Week 5: Time Series Forecasting
Methods for analyzing and predicting time series data, including ARIMA and other forecasting models.

### Week 6: Computer Vision
Fundamentals of image processing, object detection, and classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

### Week 7: Natural Language Models (LLMs)
Introduction to natural language processing (NLP) models and their applications.

### Week 8: Transformers
Understanding the architecture and function of Transformer models, which are foundational to many modern NLP applications.

### Week 9: Large Language Models (LLMs)
A deeper dive into large-scale pre-trained models like GPT and BERT, and their applications in various NLP tasks.

### Week 10: Advanced Deep Learning
Topics such as transfer learning, generative models, and advanced neural network architectures.

### Week 11: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
Introduction to MLOps practices for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.

How to Use This Repository
Feel free to browse through the folders to explore each week's content. You can find code, notes, and project files that showcase practical applications of data science and machine learning techniques.

If you are specifically interested in the Capstone Project, you can head to the dedicated folder for a detailed breakdown of the system architecture and implementation.
